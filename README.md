To get this demo running on your local machine:

1. We're using Grunt to spin up a development server for Phaser. (Phaser insists you use a local web server: https://phaser.io/tutorials/getting-started-phaser3/part2). To use Grunt commands in the terminal, you'll need to install Grunt CLI globally with your package manager of choice:
  * ```yarn global add grunt-cli``` OR
  * ```npm install -g grunt-cli```
2. In the root directory of the project, run ```grunt connect```
3. open up localhost:8000 to play!
