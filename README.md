# Cadavre Exquis
## Philly Game Mechanics
A Phaser 3 eloquent corpse game jam entry

### Instructions
We're using Grunt to spin up a development server for Phaser. (Phaser insists you use a local web server: https://phaser.io/tutorials/getting-started-phaser3/part2)

To get this demo running on your local machine:
1. Install package dependencies using your favorite package manager
    * ```npm install```
    * ```yarn install```
2. In the root directory of the project, run ```npx grunt```
3. Open http://localhost:8000 in a browser to play!
